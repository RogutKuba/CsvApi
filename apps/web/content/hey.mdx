# Title

I **love** using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

I received my [Framework Laptop DIY edition](https://frame.work) a few days ago and have been setting it up software-wise. I have it running Manjaro Linux with the Sway window manager. This is my first time using a Wayland desktop, and oh has it been a learning experience. This post will be largely about the hardware, but I plan to make one about the software once I'm more happy with my setup.

Here's what I got:
* Framework Laptop DIY Edition
* 16GB (2 x 8GB) DDR4-3200
* Intel® Wi-Fi 6E AX210 No vPro
* 1TB - WD_BLACK™ SN850 NVMe™
* USB-A Expansion Card
* USB-C Expansion Card x2
* HDMI Expansion Card
